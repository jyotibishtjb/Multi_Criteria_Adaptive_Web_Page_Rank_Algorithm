# Multi_Criteria_Adaptive_Web_Page_Rank_Algorithm

## Introduction  
This project presents a novel approach to web page ranking optimization using **Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)**, aiming to surpass traditional SEO techniques like **PageRank** and **HITS Algorithm**. The adaptive nature of the proposed solution dynamically rearranges website content to boost user engagement and site visibility.  

## Key Technologies  
- **Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)**: Inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves, this algorithm optimizes page ranking efficiently.  
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Mimics the foraging behavior of ants to find optimal paths for ranking improvement.  
- **Best-Fit Search Algorithm**: Ensures content relevance by dynamically adjusting the website layout.  

## Features  
1. **Improved SEO Performance**: Combines multiple adaptive algorithms to enhance page ranking.  
2. **Dynamic Content Arrangement**: Optimizes content layout based on user interaction patterns.  
3. **User Engagement Optimization**: Increases visibility through a data-driven approach.  

## Research Insight  
Our research demonstrates that incorporating adaptive algorithms like GWO significantly outperforms static methods. A comparative analysis with PageRank and HITS reveals a notable increase in user engagement metrics.
